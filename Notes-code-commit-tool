code commit is an aws product.
competitor to github
it works both on https and ssh protocol
Normal root user of aws console account won't work for code commit. You get folowing error message when you try to create a repository 
with root user. 
"You are signed in using a root account. You cannot configure SSH connections for a root account, and HTTPS connections for
 a root account are not recommended. Consider signing in as an IAM user and then setting up your connection."
We need to create a non root user 
Login to aws console >> Search for IAM >> Users >> Add User >> set permissions > Attach an existing policy > select AdministratorAccess
 >> Once user is created you get a link like "https://416170126936.signin.aws.amazon.com/console" >> go to that URL >> search codecommit >>
 create a repository >> click on repository >> @top right you see Clone url drop down >> select Connection steps >> select ssh >> select
 windows >> 
 Now create a ssh public and private key at your local machine at your home directory.
 ssh-keygen -t rsa
 it creates id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. Note down the path to both files
 copy and paste the content of id_rsa.pub on following path
 aws console >> login with non root user account >> search and select IAM >> select your non root user id >> select security credentials >>
 create access key >> Note down ssh key id >> click on Upload public key >> copy and paste the content of id_rsa.pub file you just created 
 in your local machine. 
 Go back to step 12 and there you copy the following under "Edit local ssh configuration""
 Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
 User Your-IAM-SSH-Key-ID-Here (the id you copied from step 18)
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/Your-Private-Key-File-Name-Here
 Now go to your local machine to your .ssh folder and create a file called config and paste the above three lines in it. 
 Get the clone url from console
go to your local machine and use command "git clone <clone url>
